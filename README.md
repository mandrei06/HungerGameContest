### Problem 1

You have a phrase that is completely in lowercase English alphabet, You
can relate it to an integer if you associate to each letter its order numbers starting with 1 ('a'->1,'b'->2,...,'z'->26)
and to the blank space a 0, and add the value of each character multiplied by 27 raised by its distance to the end of the phrase.
For example the key 'solera' would have the number 280841176(27⁰*1+27¹*18+27²*5+27³*12+27⁴*15+27⁵*19) associated with it.

Find the text associated with the number 514496116026.
### Problem 2

In the Collatz sequence each number is obtained from the previous one (n) by applying the following rules:

-If n is even, the next number is n/2.<br>
-If n is odd, the next number is 3n+1.<br>
-But if n=1, there is no next, the sequence ends.

For example for the number 13 produces the string: 13-40-20-10-5-16-8-4-2-1, which consists of 10 elements, so it is said to have length 10.

You have to multiply:
-the length of the longest string generated by a number between 1 and 1000.
-the highest absolute maximum of all strings generated by numbers between 1 and 1000.


### Problem 3
<br>
Calculate the difference between the square sum and the sum of the squares of the numbers less than or equal to a given number.
For example, if the given number were 10, the result would be 2640 (the difference between 3025 and 385), since:<br>
(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)²=3025<br>
1²+2²+3²+4²+5²+6²+7²+8²+9²+10²=385
<br><br>Calculate the difference detailed above using the value 100000 as the given number.
